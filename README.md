Task Requirements
Create a simple HTML page with basic information about yourself (aka a CV or resume).

A CV (curriculum vitae) or resume is a short, written summary of a person's career, qualifications, and education. In the description, we will use the term CV for simplicity. You can find more details here: Curriculum vitae Wikipedia.

In this task, you are to create a web version of your CV—in other words, a simple HTML page about you and your skills. However, it must be structured according to the requirements below.

This page must have:
HTML5 Doctype
A root HTML tag with a language attribute with "en-US" value and dir attribute with ltr value.
A head tag with:
A title tag with the text "Web CV - YOUR FULL NAME". For example: "Web CV - John Doe"
A meta tag with UTF-8 encoding
A link tag for adding a favicon of the type "image/x-icon" and href "images/favicon.ico".
A body tag with all the required content
A comment at the top with the text "This page is created for the 'Introduction to HTML' training course."
A header tag with: A level 1 heading with the text "Web CV - YOUR FULL NAME" (The text in h1 should be the same as in the title tag in the head.) An aside tag with a level 2 heading with the text "Phone number" and a paragraph tag after the heading with phone number in it (You can use your real number or any other number, but it must have at least five numbers to pass the test.)
A main tag with the main part of your CV containing three section tags with level 2 headings inside *(Please note that the order of these sections is important. It will be checked in the tests.)
A summary section with the text "Summary" in the heading and two paragraphs with the appropriate paragraph tag about you in general (Each paragraph should have at least 10 characters, including spaces. However, spaces at the beginning and the end do not count.)
An education section with the text "Education" in the heading and two paragraphs with the appropriate paragraph tag about your education (Each paragraph should have at least 10 characters, including spaces.)
A work experience section with the text "Work Experience" in the heading and one paragraph with the appropriate paragraph tag about your work experience (If you don't have any work experience, please use the text "None" for the content of this paragraph.)
A footer tag with a paragraph inside it with the text "© My Copyright"
